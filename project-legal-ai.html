			<p>
				In this project, I collaborated on the development of a legal document processing platform designed to digitize and interpret legal documents such as wills, national ID cards (DNIs), and property deeds. My specific responsibility was to create AI agents using the OpenAI platform that could interpret the content of these documents and transform them into structured JSON outputs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each agent was specialized in a different document type, extracting relevant information in a standardized format. After all documents were processed, a final AI assistant aggregated this information to generate a "cuaderno particional"—a legal inheritance document outlining the list of heirs and the distribution of assets.
			</p>
			<p>
				These solutions were built to work autonomously and were designed to comply with legal and privacy standards. Due to the sensitive nature of the documents involved, the source code and datasets cannot be shared.
